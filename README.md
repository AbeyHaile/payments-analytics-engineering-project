# End-to-End Analytics Engineering for a Payments Platform

📄 Full case study: View PDF : `case_study/analytics_engineering_case_study.pdf`
[case study](case_study/analytics_engineering_case_study.pdf)
This repository showcases a production-style analytics engineering project designed for a cross-border payments platform.

It demonstrates how to transform raw transactional, operational, and product data into a trusted, analytics-ready data layer using dbt.

## Project Focus
- Data modelling best practices
- Clear separation of transformation layers
- Documentation of assumptions and architecture
- Traceability between requirements and implementation
- Production-ready dbt project structure

## Instructions

See: `assessment/analytics_engineering_case_study.pdf`
[Case study Instructions](assessment/analytics_engineering_case_study.pdf)

This repository contains my proposed analytics architecture, dbt project structure, and documentation addressing the requirements outlined in the brief.

## High-Level Architecture
The analytics layer follows a structured transformation flow to ensure data quality and lineage:

```
Raw Sources
   ↓
Staging Layer
   ↓
Intermediate Layer
   ↓
Marts Layer
   ↓
Semantic Layer
```

## Key Data Sources
The architecture integrates three primary operational systems:

• **Backend Transaction System**
- Core payments
- Users
- Transfers
- Disbursements

• **Fincrime Platform**
- Fraud detection workflows
- Task queues
- Rule evaluations.

• **Amplitude**
- Product analytics events used for exploratory behavioural analysis.

## Design Principles

The design of this solution follows several analytics engineering principles:

• **Layered transformation architecture**
(staging → intermediate → marts → semantic)

• **Clear grain definition for each model**

• **Reusable intermediate models**

• **Separation of production vs exploratory models**

• **Explicit documentation of assumptions**

• **Testing and data quality checks embedded in dbt models**

## Execution Note
This repository represents the **design and architecture** for the assessment.

The project is intentionally **not runnable** because:

- Source datasets were not provided
- External systems (Backend, Fincrime, Amplitude) are not accessible
- The objective of the assessment is to evaluate architecture, modelling, and documentation rather than executable pipelines.

All models are written as they would appear in a **production dbt project**.
