# NALA Analytics Engineering Assessment

This repository contains my solution for the **NALA Senior Analytics Engineer technical assessment**.

The goal of this submission is to design a scalable analytics architecture and dbt transformation layer that integrates multiple operational data sources and exposes reliable business metrics through a semantic layer.

The repository focuses on:

- Data modelling best practices
- Clear separation of transformation layers
- Documentation of assumptions and architecture
- Traceability between requirements and implementation
- Production-ready dbt project structure

# Assessment Instructions

The original assessment brief provided by NALA is included for reference.

See: `assessment/nala_assessment_instructions.pdf`

This repository contains my proposed analytics architecture, dbt project structure, and documentation addressing the requirements outlined in the brief.

## High-Level Architecture

The analytics layer follows a layered transformation architecture:

Raw Sources
   │
   ▼
Staging Layer
   │
   ▼
Intermediate Layer
   │
   ▼
Marts Layer
   │
   ▼
Semantic Layer

## Key Data Sources

The architecture integrates three primary operational systems:

• **Backend Transaction System**
Core payments, users, transfers, and disbursements.

• **Fincrime Platform**
Fraud detection workflows, task queues, and rule evaluations.

• **Amplitude**
Product analytics events used for exploratory behavioural analysis.

Source → target mapping | docs/source_to_target_mapping.md
POC documentation | docs/poc_requirements.md
Model documentation (YAML) | dbt_project/models
AI prompt log | docs/prompt_log.md

# Design Principles

The design of this solution follows several analytics engineering principles:

• **Layered transformation architecture**
(staging → intermediate → marts → semantic)

• **Clear grain definition for each model**

• **Reusable intermediate models**

• **Separation of production vs exploratory models**

• **Explicit documentation of assumptions**

• **Testing and data quality checks embedded in dbt models**

# Execution Note

This repository represents the **design and architecture** for the assessment.

The project is intentionally **not runnable** because:

- Source datasets were not provided
- External systems (Backend, Fincrime, Amplitude) are not accessible
- The objective of the assessment is to evaluate architecture, modelling, and documentation rather than executable pipelines.

All models are written as they would appear in a **production dbt project**.
